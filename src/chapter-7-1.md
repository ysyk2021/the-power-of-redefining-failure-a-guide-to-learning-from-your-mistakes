This resilience serves as a foundation for future success and enables you to bounce back stronger in the face of adversity.

6. **Enhancing Self-Discovery**: Embracing change and uncertainty allows for self-discovery and personal transformation. Through new experiences and challenges, you gain insights into your strengths, weaknesses, passions, and values. This self-awareness paves the way for aligning your actions with your true purpose.
